=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MaxMind::DB::Writer::Tree;
    use Net::Works::Network;

    my %types = (
        color => 'utf8_string',
        dogs  => [ 'array', 'utf8_string' ],
        size  => 'uint16',
    );

    my $tree = MaxMind::DB::Writer::Tree->new(
        ip_version            => 6,
        record_size           => 24,
        database_type         => 'My-IP-Data',
        languages             => ['en'],
        description           => { en => 'My database of IP data' },
        map_key_type_callback => sub { $types{ $_[0] } },
    );

    my $network
        = Net::Works::Network->new_from_string( string => '8.23.0.0/16' );

    $tree->insert_network(
        $network,
        {
            color => 'blue',
            dogs  => [ 'Fido', 'Ms. Pretty Paws' ],
            size  => 42,
        },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution contains the code necessary to write L<MaxMind DB database
files|http://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/>. See L<MaxMind::DB::Writer::Tree>
for API docs.

=head1 WINDOWS SUPPORT

This distribution does not currently work on Windows. Reasonable patches for
Windows support are very welcome. You will probably need to start by making
L<Math::Int128> work on Windows, since we use that module's C API for dealing
with 128-bit integers to represent IPv6 addresses numerically.

=head1 SUPPORT

Please report all issues with this code using the GitHub issue tracker at
L<https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Writer-perl/issues>.

We welcome patches as pull requests against our GitHub repository at
L<https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Writer-perl>.
