- The writer now iterates over the search tree in depth-first order when the
  MaxMind::DB::Writer::Tree->iterate method is called. This means that
  networks are seen in IP address order.

- The writer now throw an error when writing out the database if it would try
  to write a record value in the search tree that is larger than the search
  tree can handle. For example, if your record size is 24 bits, you cannot
  write a value larger than (2^24)-1. Fixed by Greg Oschwald.

- The Build.PL file shipped with this distro now dies if you try to run it on
  Windows, since this module simply doesn't work on Windows.

- The merge-on-collision feature was fairly broken. Fixed by Greg Oschwald.
